# Scusa Mi! Italiano Mobile App

## Introduction

The goal of the Scusa Mi! Italiano Mobile App Concept project is to deliver a working concept mobile application that aims to integrate many of the Scusa Mi! Italiano’s functions and more, such as providing an interface for users to view information about the restaurant, browse current menu items, place orders, make a booking to reserve a table for a future date, leave feedback, as well as make their own account to save their details and preferences.

The mobile application will have cross-platform support for Android and iOS devices.
The theme, style and colours of the app will take inspiration from the company’s current branding, particularly its website at the time of this project’s development. This mobile app would exist alongside this website as an alternative way to find information about the restaurant, contact the venue and place reservations.

The resulting app will not interfere with the Client’s current existing system and it may be connected to a separate system for testing purposes. There may be future plans to completely integrate the app into the Client’s system – however, that is outside this project’s scope. If any decision will be made to continue this project and implement such integration, it shall be considered as a separate project with its own requirements and objectives.
